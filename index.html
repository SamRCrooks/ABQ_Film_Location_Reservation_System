  <div class="col-sm-6"> <b>Motivation </b> <br> <p class="devProcessText">
    There is no question that the film industry is booming in New Mexico, as within the last year Netflix bought Albuquerque studios and NBC Universal announced to build its own new studio complex in Albuquerque. Film shoots often require numerous locations, and the New Mexico film officeâ€™s website provides a database of over 8,000 available locations for production companies and independent filmmakers. However, this current system can be time consuming and inefficient as  reservations can only be made by contacting the owner of each location directly. Furthermore, there is no way to quickly determine whether or not a site has already been reserved by someone else at a specified time. To address these limitations, I developed an interactive map-based reservation web app for film sites in Albuquerque. Below details the process in developing the app.

  <div class="col-sm-8"><b>1. Data Extraction and Processing </b> <br>
<p class="devProcessText">
Location data from Albuquerqueâ€™s open data website was used [2]. It contains a dataset of movie locations for 1,000 productions shot (406 unique locations) in non-residential sites within the city of Albuquerque that required a film permit. The data is stored as a JSON file (JavaScript Object Notation). Snippet of location attributes within the JSON file:
</p>
<pre>
â€œattributes": {
    "OBJECTID": 4599,
    "Title": "Breaking Bad",
    "Type": "TV Series Season 2",
    "IMDbLink": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0903747/episodes?season=2&ref_=tt_eps_sn_2",
    "Address": "5650 University Boulevard SE",
    "Site": "Albuquerque Studios",
    "ShootDate": 1216166400000,
    "OriginalDetails": "Albuquerque Studios"
   }, 
<br>
attributes": {
    "OBJECTID": 4893,
    "Title": "Easy Money",
    "Type": "TV Series",
    "IMDbLink": "http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1252367/",
    "Address": "9201 Pan American Freeway NE",
    "Site": "I25 Studios formerly Philips Semiconductor Plant",
    "ShootDate": 1222992000000,
    "OriginalDetails": "Philips Building - 9201 Pan American Fwy."
   }
 </pre>
 <p class="devProcessText">
The only necessary elements from this dataset are the site names and their corresponding latitude and longitude coordinates so that they can be plotted on a map. Unfortunately, this dataset doesnâ€™t include latitude and longitude coordinates; however, it does have addresses which can be converted to coordinates. In data_conversion.js, I extracted the site names and addresses of each location by creating a for loop that iterates through the location attributes and then saves the site names to a list called sites and saves the addresses to list called addresses. The addresses were then converted to a list of coordinates using the MapQuest geocoding tool [3]. Finally, the cleansed address and coordinate data was saved as lists into a new file called data.js. Processed data snippet:
</p>
  <pre>
    var sites = ['Naral Office','El Madrid Bar ', I-25 Studios' ... ];
    var coordinates = [[35.0860946, -106.650725194778], [35.1009602, -106.6460408],
                      [35.0841157, -106.6480531] ... ];
  </pre>
  <p class="devProcessText">
In the future, it may be wise to store the data as a JavaScript object instead of lists because I may need data attributes beyond site names and coordinates, but lists are suitable for my purposes. </p>
</div>
  <div class="col-sm-4"><b>2. Plotting Locations on a Map</b> <br>
      <ul>A map was created using Leaflet, an open-source JavaScript library for interactive maps [4]. </ul>
       <ul> Downloaded a movie camera icon PNG. Created red and green versions. Green indicates a location is vacant. Red indicates reserved. </ul>
       <ul> A for loop iterates through the coordinates and site names. A new map marker is created at each coordinate and the corresponding site name is bound with each markerâ€™s pop-up. </ul>
       <ul> When a marker is clicked on, the pop-up becomes visible. </ul>
  <br>  <br>
    <b>3. Site Reservation Functionality </b> <br>
     <ul> Created a green reservation button for each pop-up. </ul>
     <ul>When the reservation button is clicked, a button action listener is triggered which changes the locationâ€™s icon from green to red.</ul>
     <ul>Added a calendar widget in each pop up so that the user can select the start and end dates of their reservation. </ul>

     <br> <br>
     <b>4. Payment </b>  
   <ul>A paypal button is prompted after a location is reserved.</ul>
   <ul>In a final product, the cost would be calculated based on the location and reservation duration. </ul>

  <div class="col-sm-6"><b>Future Work</b>
    <ul>Include all locations from the nm film office website, not just locations in ABQ. Currently, 406 locations are being plotted.</ul>
    <ul>Use node to retrieve and display the data from CABQ live so that new locations that are added will be updated.
</ul>
    <ul>Add contact info for each site owner, in case a potential client has questions.</ul>
      <ul>
Implement blockchain technology to make the reservation system decentralized.</ul>
    <ul>A reservation system like the one developed in this project could be applied to other types of businesses, not just film, such as restaurant reservation.
